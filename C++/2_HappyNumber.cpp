/* Approach:- We will keep splitting the digits and perform a^2+b^2....+m^2, and then perform the same operation with
the resultant,we will find a pattern that the sum of the digits of the number will either going to be equal to n or 1.
The idea is to loop until we either find 1 as sum or a number which is already present in the set
