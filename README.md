Welcome Contributors,

This repository is created for helping beginners and intermediates to learn about open source projects and motivate them
for contributing in open source projects. There are many experts out there but everyone was a begginer once.

This repo is created to help all such people by making them aware of open source and how they can work in a team by making small contributions. We have included a list of basic programs here which are helpful for graduate students to make contributions. To make it more exhaustive list, we will keep adding new programs in the list which is surely going to be very helpful for all such beginners.


You are invited to make changes in this repository, we will accept your pull request if you fulfil all the basic criterias of program writing as listed below - 


- A valid pull request is one that is accepted by the maintainer of the project you submit it to.

- A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. 

- The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.


Note:
--- 

A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.
If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

4. A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.

6. Please take care of the file name, function name and variables for higher chances of getting your request accepted.

7. FileName should be in following format - Qn_main_function.extension, where Qn denotes the question no, main_function is main functionality of the program and finally extensuon which is dependent on programming language you are going to follow for that particular program.
Example - For the first program in the list I will make file name - Q1_factorial_sum.c or Q1_factorial_sum.cpp or Q1_factorial_sum.py etc.

8. Indent the code properly with necessary comments in the file.
