Welcome Contributors,

This repositry has been created as a medium for developers to participate in the __Hactoberfest 2021__ event. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official __[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)__ website for your pull requests to count.

This event is for novice as well as expert developers who want to make contributions to Open Source projects and also participate in the event.

This repo is created to help all such people by making them aware of open source and how they can work in a team by making small contributions. We have included a list of basic programs here which are helpful for graduate students to make contributions. To make it more exhaustive list, we will keep adding new programs in the list which is surely going to be very helpful for all such beginners.


## You are invited to make changes in this repository, we will accept your pull request if you fulfill all the basic criterias of program writing as listed below:
---

- Refer to contibution.md for rules to contribute.

- A valid pull request is one that is accepted by the maintainer of the project you submit it to.

- A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. 

- The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

- Use the problem list present in the repository to select the problem statement to make your contributions.


Details:
---

1. Make sure to write your code in the respective folders so it can be easily reviewed.

2. FileName should be in following format - quesNo_firstName_lastName.extension, where quesNo denotes the question no in the problem list, firstName_lastName is is the full name of the contributor and finally extension which is dependent on programming language you are going to follow for that particular program. Make sure to add the file in the respective folder of that particular language.

Example - For the first program in the list I will make file name - 1_deepak_uniyal.c or 1_deepak_uniyal.cpp or 1_deepak_uniyal.py etc.

3. If your program is not described or present in the problem list given then you can name your file as fileName_firstName_lastName.extension, where fileName is the fileName you want to give and firstName_lastName is your full name.

Example - quickSort_deepak_uniyal.cpp, etc.

4. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

5. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

6. A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.

7. Please take care of the file name, function name and variables for higher chances of getting your request accepted.

8. Indent the code properly with necessary comments in the file.

9. If the folder for that language is not present make sure to make the folder first then write your code in that folder.

10. If you have multiple files related to each other you can make a seperate folder inside the language folder and add the files in that separate folder.


Note:
--- 

- A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.

- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

- If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
